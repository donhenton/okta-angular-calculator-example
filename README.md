### Create a New OIDC App in Okta

To create a new OIDC app on Okta:

1. Log in to your developer account, navigate to **Applications**, and click on **Add Application**.
3. Select **Single-Page App** and click **Next**. 
4. Give the application a name, change all instances of `localhost:8080` to `localhost:4200` and click **Done**.

#### Server Configuration

Set your `issuer` and copy the `clientId` in to `src/app/app.module.ts`. 

**NOTE:** The value of `{yourOktaDomain}` should be something like `dev-123456.okta.com`. Make sure you don't include `-admin` in the value!

```ts
OktaAuthModule.initAuth({
  issuer: 'https://{yourOktaDomain}/oauth2/default',
  redirectUri: 'http://localhost:8080/implicit/callback',
  clientId: '{clientId}'
})
```
